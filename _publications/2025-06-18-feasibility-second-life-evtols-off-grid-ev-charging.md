This research investigates the feasibility of incorporating second-life batteries (SLBs) from electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft into multipurpose garage parking off-grid PV electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS). The suggested EVCS is used to evaluate the aging characteristics of both first-life (FL) and second-life (SL) batteries. The findings indicated that despite the initial capacity of 85% and elevated internal resistance in the SLBs during their first eVTOL application, they had sufficient capacity and power to continue operating for a further 5 years until reaching the end of life at 50% state of health in EVCS. The economic assessments of the suggested method indicate that SLBs achieve a net present value (NPV) of 112.75kover20years,surpassingthe 95.11k NPV of systems using pristine batteries. This underscores the cost-efficiency of SLBs, although their additional maintenance demands. The results confirm SLBs as a feasible and economically sustainable option to enhance the infrastructure of decentralized EVCS.
