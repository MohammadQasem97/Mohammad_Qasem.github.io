This research investigates the feasibility of incorporating second-life batteries (SLBs) from electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft into multipurpose garage parking off-grid PV electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS). The suggested EVCS is used to evaluate the aging characteristics of both first-life (FL) and second-life (SL) batteries.
