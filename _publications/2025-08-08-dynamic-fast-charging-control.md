This research introduces a novel dynamic fast-charging control approach incorporated into an age-aware Battery Management System (BMS). The proposed system utilizes a simplified electrochemical model and integrates closed-loop observers to detect lithium plating and Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) growth, allowing real-time updates to charging profiles depending on battery states such as the state of charge (SoC), state of health (SoH), and temperature. Experimental validation is conducted using NMC811 LIB cells arranged in a 4S9P pack configuration at ambient temperatures of 25 °C and 0 °C to meet the operational requirements of eVTOL applications. The results indicate that the dynamic fast-charging controller achieves an 80\% SoC in less than 28 minutes while avoiding lithium plating and excessive SEI growth, enhancing battery longevity by 25.2% and 8.8% compared to CC-CV and MCC-CV, respectively, and reducing internal impedance growth by 45% and 15%. These enhancements ensure safe operation and consistent performance in high-power, low-temperature conditions, where traditional techniques often fail. This study highlights the feasibility of the dynamic charging technique for real-world applications, improving economic efficiency and reliability in eVTOL operations.
