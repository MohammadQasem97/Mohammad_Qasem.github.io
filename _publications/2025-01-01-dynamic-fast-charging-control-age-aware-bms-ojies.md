The manuscript integrates a reduced-order electrochemical model within an embedded BMS to enable fast‑charging under aging-aware constraints. A plating‑aware objective modulates current trajectories based on online parameter updates informed by thermal and voltage measurements, balancing charge time and degradation mechanisms.
