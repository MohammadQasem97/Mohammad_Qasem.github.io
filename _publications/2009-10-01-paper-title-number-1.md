This paper develops a hybrid framework that leverages synthetic datasets derived from physics-based battery models and experimental cycling profiles to optimize Li-ion battery performance prediction for electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) applications. By integrating synthetic data into model parameterization, the work addresses challenges in limited real-world flight test data availability, enabling improved estimation of state-of-charge (SoC) and state-of-health (SoH). The methodology is validated against commercial NMC811/graphite cells, demonstrating strong agreement between predicted and measured performance across varying C-rates and mission profiles. The results offer insights into reducing development time and cost for next-generation aerial mobility battery systems.
