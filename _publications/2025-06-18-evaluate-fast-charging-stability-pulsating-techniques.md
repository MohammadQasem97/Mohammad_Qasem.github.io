This study examines the impact of pulse-current constant-voltage (PCCV) charging on the performance and degradation of NMC811 lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in comparison to the CC-CV approach. 10 unique experiments were performed, altering pulse frequencies, duty cycles, and peak current levels to assess their effects on charging duration, discharge capacity, SEI growth, and Li+ concentration.
