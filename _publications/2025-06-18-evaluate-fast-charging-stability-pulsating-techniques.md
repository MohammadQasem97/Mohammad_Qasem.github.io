This paper examines pulsed-current charging strategies across C‑rates and frequencies, quantifying voltage stability and temperature evolution. Results highlight regimes that maintain terminal voltage within safety limits while mitigating thermal rise, indicating practical fast‑charge windows for NMC811/graphite cells.
