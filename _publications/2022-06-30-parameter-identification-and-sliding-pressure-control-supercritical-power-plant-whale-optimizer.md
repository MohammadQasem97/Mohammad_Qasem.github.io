his paper presents a novel approach for developing a supercritical cleaner coal power plantâ€™s sliding pressure control strategy. First, using Whale Optimizer, a nonlinear identified transfer matrix model was created (WO). By comparing simulations and errors, the WO clearly outperforms the GA and Grey-Wolf Optimizer (GWO) techniques on parameter identification. The model also includes a multivariable PI/PD controller for improved plant operation.
