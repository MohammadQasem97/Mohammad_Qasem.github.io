This review presents a comparative analysis of more than 50 studies on age-aware fast charging, emphasizing the balance between charging duration and long-term battery performance. Age-aware fast charging techniques are systematically categorized based on modeling complexity, parameterization requirements, cell chemistry, and the extent of real-world validation. Their comparative strengths and weaknesses are rigorously assessed in terms of costâ€“benefit tradeoffs and practical feasibility. Finally, key research gaps are identified to support the implementation of age-aware fast charging techniques in EV and eVTOL systems.
