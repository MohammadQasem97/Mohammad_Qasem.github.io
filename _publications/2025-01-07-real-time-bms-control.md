The present study introduces a comprehensive methodology that encompasses the calibration, validation, and application of two separate Li-ion battery electrochemical models: the equivalent circuit model and the electrochemistry-based model. The calibration and validation of these models are based on experimental data conducted under various operating conditions, including charge/discharge rates, calendaring temperature, and Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization (HPPC) tests. After the successful validation process, these models are used to generate synthetic data tailored to real-world applications, particularly electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles (eVTOL). The primary objective is to assess the precision of battery performance prediction, wherein the synthetic data is thoroughly compared with real experimental data.
