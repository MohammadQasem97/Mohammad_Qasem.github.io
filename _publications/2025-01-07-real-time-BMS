This paper implements a reduced-order electrochemical model with lithium-plating side reactions on embedded BMS hardware and designs a plating-aware charging controller. Experiments on commercial 21700 cells show that the controller mitigates plating while preserving practical charge times, highlighting a path to health-aware fast charging suitable for deployment.
