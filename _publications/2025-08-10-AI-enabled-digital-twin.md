This paper proposes an AI-enabled digital twin framework to optimize fast charging performance via real-time health monitoring. The framework incorporates a predictive model that optimizes the charging current based on lithium plating and SEI growth using data from incomplete battery discharge cycles, enabling dynamic estimation of battery health. The experimental results demonstrate the framework's robustness across varying ambient temperatures and initial state of charge (SoC) conditions. A novel real-time estimation model within the framework achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 0.5% and 0.4% for both battery capacity and internal resistance. Additionally, the proposed framework preserved battery capacity of  87.6% at 25 Â°C compared to 81.4% and 64.3% for MCC-CV and CC-CV, respectively. This approach helps mitigate battery side reactions during fast charging, while reducing the time required to reach 80% SoC to less than 25 min, compared to 35 min for MCC-CV and 39 minutes for CC-CV after 200 cycles. These findings confirm the framework's ability to enhance age-aware fast charging efficiency while extending battery lifespan.
