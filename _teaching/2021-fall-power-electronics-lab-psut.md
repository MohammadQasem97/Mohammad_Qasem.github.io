Taught DC–DC converters (buck, boost, buck–boost, flyback): basic operation, duty cycle, and steady-state calculations. Covered AC–DC rectifiers (diode bridge, controlled rectifier) and DC–AC inverters (H-bridge, SPWM). Led hands-on labs on gating signals, switching loss, filters, and measurements with oscilloscopes and current probes. Gave short pre-lab talks, wrote clear lab handouts, ran check-offs, held office hours, and graded notebooks and reports with a simple checklist.
