I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at **Southern Methodist University (SMU)**, specializing in **lithium-ion battery modeling, age-aware fast-charging control, and Battery Management System (BMS) design**. My research integrates **real-time electrochemical modeling, digital twin frameworks, and AI-driven health estimation** to develop safe, efficient, and durable charging strategies for next-generation energy storage systems.

Before joining SMU, I conducted doctoral research at the **Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT)**, focusing on advanced battery modeling, state estimation, and cell/pack testing. I hold an **M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering** from **Princess Sumaya University for Technology (PSUT)**, where I graduated first in my class, and a **B.Sc. in Electrical Power Engineering** from **Al-Balqa’ Applied University (BAU)**.
