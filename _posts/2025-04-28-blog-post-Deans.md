I’m honored to share that I was awarded the **Moody Dean’s Dissertation Fellowship** at the **SMU Lyle School of Engineering**. The fellowship supports the final phase of my Ph.D., which focuses on **advanced lithium-ion battery models** and **age-aware battery management systems (BMS)** for safe, fast charging.

**Why this matters:** the work aims to enable health-aware fast charging by combining electrochemical modeling, digital-twin estimation, and controller design to prevent lithium plating and extend battery life.

**Gratitude:** Sincere thanks to **Prof. Mahesh Krishnamurthy** for his guidance, and to the **SMU Lyle** and **Moody School of Graduate & Advanced Studies** communities for their support.
