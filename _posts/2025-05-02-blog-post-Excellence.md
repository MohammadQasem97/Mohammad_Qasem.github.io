I’m excited to share some wonderful news from the past month that has had a meaningful impact on my Ph.D. journey. It’s been a time of recognition, and I’m truly honored to have received several major awards that reflect the progress and significance of my research. ![excellence2025](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67729def-e0e9-49cc-9679-a9354fdf3f96)


I was awarded the Dean’s Moody Dissertation Fellowship, which offers generous support as I work toward completing my dissertation. I also received the Excellence in Research and Innovation Award from the Lyle School of Engineering—an acknowledgment of the contributions and outcomes of my work. Additionally, I was honored with the Frederick E. Terman Award from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, recognizing academic excellence in my discipline.

These recognitions mean a great deal to me and serve as a reminder that hard work, focus, and perseverance do lead to rewarding outcomes. But none of this would have been possible without the guidance and support of those around me.

I’m deeply grateful to my advisor, Prof. Mahesh Krishnamurthy for his consistent guidance, encouragement, and belief in my potential throughout my Ph.D. journey. His mentorship has greatly influenced the way I approach challenges, think critically, and pursue impactful research in my field.

My sincere appreciation goes to the SMU Lyle School of Engineering and the Moody School of Graduate & Advanced Studies | SMU as well as Dean Dr. Nader Jalili of Lyle and Dean Dr. Robin Poston of Moody, for fostering a community that values innovation, academic excellence, and student growth.

A special thanks to Dr. Said Al-Hallaj for his continued mentorship and support. His advice has played a key role in shaping my research path and overall development as a scholar.
