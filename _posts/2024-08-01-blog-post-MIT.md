We’re thrilled to be recognized for our ongoing partnership with Beam Global at MIT A+B conference. Over the past two years, we have taken a deep dive into battery modeling, pack design, fast charging, BMS and thermal management to push the boundaries of power electronic solutions for electrified transportation. This work around ROI and RUL for second life batteries is one of several projects we are partnering on, with an end goal to extend battery life, carry out a techno-economic analysis and enhance safety and reliability. Be on the lookout for a publication soon on this topic!

A huge shoutout to our dedicated team members—Mohammad Qasem, Yazan Yassin, Sadam Ratrout, Mariana Haddadin and Jay Steinberg—whose hard work in setting up experiments and gathering data for over a year (and continuing) has been instrumental to our progress. Your efforts are truly appreciated!
