This paper develops a hybrid framework leveraging synthetic datasets derived from physics-based battery models and experimental cycling profiles to optimize Li-ion battery performance prediction for electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) applications. By incorporating synthetic data into model parameterization, the approach addresses limited availability of real-world flight test data and improves estimation of state-of-charge (SoC) and state-of-health (SoH). Validation against commercial NMC811/graphite cells demonstrates agreement across C-rates and mission profiles, supporting accelerated development of aerial mobility battery systems.
